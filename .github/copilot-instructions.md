# Copilot Instructions for AdventOfCode_2025

## Project Overview
This repository is for Advent of Code 2025 solutions generated with the help of the GitHub Copilot. 
<br>Each day's solution is in its own package day01, day02 etc.

## Patterns & Conventions
- **AdventOfCodeSolver:** This is the base class for all solutions, providing input parsing, solution solving, output formatting, and solution timing.
- **Solution Entry Point:** Each day's solution should extend the AdventOfCode solver and implement the required methods
- **Input Parsing:** Input data is read from standard input, pasted from the adventofcode.com website.
- **No external dependencies:**
