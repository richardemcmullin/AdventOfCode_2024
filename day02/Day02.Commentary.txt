Sure the code works, but it is hardly maintainable code.  The logic is a bit tricky and 
the variable names are just slightly off.

Note that after solving part2, the AI did not refactor part1 appropriately to be in alignment.
We can see how the AI will create additional technical debt.

Recommend the solution Day02_RM.java in comparison.
