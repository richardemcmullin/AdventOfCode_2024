General observations

AI did not solve part 2 on the first try

The AI code was slower than the RM code in solving the puzzle

Part 1: 155ms vs 4ms  AI solution was 40x slower (but was not prompted to optimize)
Part 2: 70ms vs 24ms  3x slower (and had been prompted to optimize the solution)

Here is the full diaglog:

RM: Solve Part 1 in Day11 AI... followed by the part 1 text

---

AI:
Part 1 for Day 11 AI is implemented: the code parses the input stones, 
simulates 25 blinks according to the rules, and returns the final stone count.

There is a minor visibility error in solvePart2()
â€”the method should be public to match the base class. 

Let me know if you want this fixed or if you want to proceed with testing part 1.

---

RM: fix it.

---

The AI could not fix the issue, so I resolved it manually.

---

The test worked, and produced the correct result, but inefficiently.

---

RM: Implement part 2... (pasted part 2 of the puzzle)

---

AI: Part 2 for Day 11 AI is now implemented. The code simulates 75 blinks using the same transformation rules 
and returns the final stone count. You can run the solution to get the answer for your input.

---

RM: The solution ran out of Java heap space, what optimizations do you suggest for part 2.

---

AI: The current approach simulates every stone explicitly, 
causing exponential growth and heap exhaustion. For part 2, 
optimize by tracking only the count of stones by their digit-length 
and value patterns, rather than storing every stone.

Recommended optimizations:

State Compression: Represent stones as a map from stone value (or digit pattern) to count, instead of a list of strings.
Dynamic Programming: For each blink, update counts based on transformation rules, not explicit stone lists.
Avoid Storing Actual Stones: Only store how many stones of each type exist at each step.

Would you like me to refactor part 2 to use a map-based dynamic programming approach for efficient simulation?

---

RM: Yes

---

AI: Part 2 is now optimized using a map-based dynamic programming approach. 
The code tracks stone counts by value, avoiding heap exhaustion and enabling 
efficient simulation for 75 blinks. You can run the solution to get the answer for large inputs.

The AI code completed and produced the correct result.
