The AI was unable to solve part 2 of the puzzle.

After the third attempt, the AI posted this response...

The previous approach for counting contiguous straight fence sides 
was too complex and error-prone. For this puzzle, each straight 
section of fence is simply a maximal contiguous run of boundary 
edges in the same direction, not every individual edge.

A correct and simpler approach is:

For each region, for each direction, scan the grid and count the 
number of maximal contiguous boundary runs (not every edge).

For each cell in the region, if it is a boundary in a direction and 
either it is the start of a run (previous cell is not a boundary 
or not in region), count it as a new side.
I will update part 2 to use this robust method.

Part 2 has been updated to count maximal contiguous straight fence 
sides for each region by scanning for runs in each direction, matching 
the puzzle's definition of a "side." Please run the solution and verify 
the output.
