On Day07, the pattern of slower code that is more difficult to read has continued.


Also, the AI initially generated an incorrect solution. (see Day07_AI_Original)

Prompt: the method canMakeTestValue does not work - try again

AI Response: 

The issue with your (*what - it wasn't me, I did not write that*) canMakeTestValue method is that 
it does not respect the left-to-right operator placement as described in the puzzle. 
It tries all pairs, but the puzzle requires you to insert operators only between 
consecutive numbers, always evaluating left-to-right.

Correct approach:

- Start with the first number.
- For each operator position, recursively apply + or * (or concat for part 2) to the next number, 
then continue with the result and the rest of the list.

I'll update both methods to use this left-to-right recursive approach.

Day07_AI.java+24-39
Both recursive methods are now fixed to use strict left-to-right operator placement, as required by the puzzle. 
This should produce the correct results for both part 1 and part 2.

*the corrected file did produce the correct result.
