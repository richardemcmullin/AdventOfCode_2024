The AI was able to easily solve this puzzle, which was not a difficult puzzle

The prompts aiding the development of the RM solution were appropriate and helpful

There was a large difference in performance between the RM and AI solutions:

Part 1: 7ms vs 33ms - the AI solution is 4x slower
Part 2: 2ms vs 33ms - the AI solution is 16x slower !!???

continues the pattern of the AI code being less efficient at solving the problem.
